# Elastick_Pendulum
Hi, this little project is about an elastic pendulum.

You can:
- set parameters you want and check, how is works in real time
- change parameters right in time of simulation
- check path
- replace pendulum 
- make simulation slow or faster

To build and run do this in terminal:

`mkdir build

cd build/

cmake ..

make

./Elastic_pendulum`

# Requirements
